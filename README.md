# number-guessing-game
A simple number guessing game written in Python

A simple Python-based **Number Guessing Game** where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a given range.

-How It Works
1. The player enters a **lower bound** and an **upper bound**.
2. The program picks a **random number** between these bounds.
3. The player has **7 chances** to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the program tells you if your guess is **too high** or **too low**.
5. If you guess the number correctly, you win. Otherwise, the program reveals the number at the end.
